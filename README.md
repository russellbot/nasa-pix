# Description
This front end application was built with the Reactjs framework in conjunction with Redux to manage the state. This site will load ten random pictures with descriptions from the NASA API.  A seachbox enables you to search for keywords in the pictures' title, description, and copyright.  Pictures may be added to a favorites page that is stored in local storage.

# Installation
To contribute to this work simply fork and clone the repository and then run npm install. All packages will be installed upon that command.

# API's Used
NASA's API can be found at https://api.nasa.gov/
